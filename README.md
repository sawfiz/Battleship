# Battleship
A project from the Odin Project, Javascript

Features:
- Drag and drop placement of ships
- Ships images in the game board
- Random placement of human and computer fleet
- Algorithm to make computer bomb around hits
- Toggle switch to allow cheating

What I learned
- OOP
- Unit testing
- Algorithm to make computer play smarter
- Drag and drop
- Showing part of image

To Do:
- When dragging a ship, if the ship has already been rotate, the image being dragged is still not turned
- After dragging a ship, the ship image zooms back to it's original location.  I want the dragged ship to disappar
- Disallow clicking once game over. 
- Perhaps better UI
  - Popup to ask user to deploy fleet
  - Popup to alert user to start playing game
  - Popup when game over
